Django REST framework implementation 
------------------------------------

Ok, A short intro on what it is all about: Especially the DRF.

Django REST framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. Its main benefit is that it makes serialization much easier.

Django REST framework is based on Django’s class-based views, so it’s an excellent option if you’re familiar with Django. It adopts implementations like class-based views, forms, model validator, QuerySet, and more.
